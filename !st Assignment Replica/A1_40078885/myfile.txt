Having worked in software industry and being a graduate student at Concordia University, I am very interested to work as a part time employee at your firm.
Apart from my academic profile, I have also been actively participating in extra-curricular activities. These activities required technical, managerial, physical, and creative thinking skills. These activities have modeled me towards a better personality.
I started my internship at Tata Consultancy Services in my last Semester of Bachelor’s which motivated me to work on projects like eAttendance app and then I worked at SISL Infotech for a project of NIC(National Informatics Center). It made me sharpen my skills on C# MVC, jQuery and SQL. I learnt to solve complex programs and Data Structures on multi-structure architecture.
I have recently been admitted to master’s program in Applied Computer Science at Concordia University, Montreal. I'm passionate about technology and its applications to solve real-life problems. I always tend to learn about the latest trends in technology and adapt to it. I want to continue my career as a part time software developer along with my studies here in Montreal, and your firm is the best-suited company according to my skills. I am sure that you will find my profile well suited for the mentioned job opening at your firm.
Thank You for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.
